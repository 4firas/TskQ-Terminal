Author's description:

Another close cousin of the gold version of this similar cursor set is this Windows XP Silver cursor set. This is an HD version of this classic silver pack for Windows XP. This was remade by the DeviantArt user named Come2Back for Windows 10 users to enjoy in a higher resolution. This cursor set was included in Windows XP and older classic versions of Windows like Windows 95 and Windows 98. This brings back nostalgia from the old days of Windows.

This cursor set has been upscaled and updated by the original author from the link above. There are 15 cursors in this pack in HD format for Windows 10 users to use and enjoy. All the credit goes to the original author who edited and upscaled this cursor set.
